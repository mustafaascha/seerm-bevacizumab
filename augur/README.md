# Augur  
This is a package for my dissertation examining frequencies and treatments for brain metastases in lung, breast, and skin cancers in SEER-Medicare data. 

To test the package contained here, do the following:   
1. Set your current working directory to "brain-metastases/augur"
2. Open an R session
3. If you don't have devtools, install it. Otherwise, run the command `devtools::load_all()`
4. Note that the data files are contained in two places--there are sampled files available in "brain-metastases/cache/samples_separated", while the whole data is available in "brain-metastases/seerm". To read one of the files, I suggest referring to the folders as "../infiles/FILENAME_HERE" or "../cache/samples_separated/FILENAME_HERE".
